No secret values are printed.

------------------------------------------------------------

CHECK: Git available
STATUS: PASS
DETAILS: Git command is available.

CHECK: Git repository detected
STATUS: PASS
DETAILS: .git directory exists.

CHECK: Current branch
STATUS: PASS
DETAILS: Current branch: usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--no-lazy-fetch]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)

   init       Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add        Add file contents to the index
   mv         Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore    Restore working tree files
   rm         Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect     Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff       Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep       Print lines matching a pattern
   log        Show commit logs
   show       Show various types of objects
   status     Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   backfill   Download missing objects in a partial clone
   branch     List, create, or delete branches
   commit     Record changes to the repository
   history    EXPERIMENTAL: Rewrite history
   merge      Join two or more development histories together
   rebase     Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset      Set `HEAD` or the index to a known state
   switch     Switch branches
   tag        Create, list, delete or verify tags

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch      Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull       Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push       Update remote refs along with associated objects
